# hybrid-ecs-vs-standard
This is Unity3d project used to test the performance differences between hybrid ECS and the standard monobehavior model.

Once you have cloned the project onto your machine, simply follow these steps to get your project up and running using ECS:
1. Using Unity HUB open the project up at the directory you cloned the project.
2. Update the player preferences to use .Net 4.x and close Unity.
3. Start unity again and ensure you have the latest version of Entities package via Unity's package manager.
4. You are now good to start playing around with the hybrid & standard scenes.
